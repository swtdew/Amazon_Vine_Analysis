![Q3]

We cannot say for certain based just the 5 star and helpful review status of whether or not the Vine program creates bias in reviews. the percentage of 5 star reviews for Vine customers was higher than those of regular reviewers, but since the Vine customers accounted for so little helpful reviews vs regular reviewers, we cannot say for certain based on your calculations as is, if there is truly a right leaning bias towards 5 star reviews with Vine .

Such factors as whom the reviewer is... an influencer or celebrity may skew more customers to write positive reviews. We have not and probably should consider how Vine reviewers rate a product in other star ranges 1-4 to see if their review ratings skew to the right more than regular reviewers. Also one last thing to note, Are Vine Reviews done on products that may particular need a boost in reviews or as a form of a paid advertisement vs. a random product selected for review.

We should also chart the review stats for Customer_id's that review too often, as they may have their own bias in reviews (only creating negative reviews)
